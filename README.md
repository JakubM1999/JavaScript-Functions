For me this assignment was bit hard and took lot more time than I expected. Ofcorse I learned a lot by doing it and I am very proud that I was able to do it, although this isn't perfect I still got a lot to learn when it comes to functions in javascript and I hope that I did't make any major mistakes. I got to say though I very much like it, I think it's fun to create these functions and play around with them beacuse it always gives you a diffrend outcome and I think that that's exiting.
